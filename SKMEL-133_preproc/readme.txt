The scripts require the following data files obtained from Chris Sander group (http://projects.sanderlab.org/pertbio/):
 - Antibody Correlation.xls
 - slide_plates_sample description.xlsx
 - Weiqing_2010 data+2011 May pMEK_good pMEK.xlsx - in this file for convenience I have deleted columns C, D and II, and row 2.
